This project contains a schematic and board design for a breakout board for
the Microchip MCP2210 with a pin header to connect an SPI flash device.

Both files are in the file format of EAGLE from Autodesk.

Assembly suggestions: Use a very fine tipped soldering iron set to 300-350 C,
use very small diameter rosin core solder wire and DO use extra flux.

In the `pictures` directory you can see some high resolution pictures taken
of a device built (hand-soldered) using this design.
